He has been buying fish from Mtera, which is 130 km away and selling the fishes in Dodoma town.  He has a small staff who sell fish with him.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is a large demand for fish in Dodoma, but it is difficult to find them, for sellers must travel a a long distance to the lake or coast.  Dodoma is a landlocked town. Most local sellers must purchase fish from a middle man. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe business started with grant of Tsh 80.000.00 and now the business has reached a value of Tsh 500,000.00, which is over ($400).  This loan will be a huge boost for Peter to rapidly accelerate the business.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe main use of the profits from the business will be to send their children to school and meet other family needs.

Currently, the business value is Tsh. 400,000.\r\nCurrently, one US dollar is worth 1,174.90 Tanzanian Shillings.  Thus, the value of this business is now over $300 US.  Maintaining cash in a business is important for future purchasing.  A loan will highly accelerate the possibilities for this group.  Meru has a small staff and it has been observed that they are a very successful  team and that is why they now qualify for this loan from Kiva.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe used clothing business is very successful in Tanzania, as it is in all of East Africa.  Many East Africans have found great use for used clothing from Europe and America.  It is less expensive than African clothing and of pretty high quality.  Thus, you can see many Tanzanias walking around wearing t-shirts displaying American brands, schools, regions, performers and sports teams.  This is just a reality here.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe loan will expand the business by openning a small shop for selling more clothes also she will be able to go to Dar-es-salaam to buy stock for the business and the business.  The ability to travel this far will set them apart here in Dodoma, for most locals do not have the opportunity to make such a long voyage for business.  This will allow them to buy the clothes as they come straight into the country from foreign lands.									296	1			town	-6.183333 35.75	point	Dodoma	TZ	Tanzania	500	2005-04-14 01:27:55 -0400		500	none		lender	3	0

She has run her own tailoring shop in the center of the town for the past three years, and lives in a small village on the outskirts of town with her husband and two small children.  She mends and makes simple clothes for people in the neighborhood. However, her primary sewing machine has become unreliable and she does not have the financial ability to purchase a new one.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nWith this loan, she plans to do two things.  First, she will purchase a new sewing machine.  Secondly, she will fix up the back of her store where people will be able to try on the clothes she alters or makes for them.  The flexibility of the Kiva loan has special significance for Zara, given her familyâ€™s situation.  Her husband, who has been unable to find outside employment, tends to the familyâ€™s garden, the produce of which will be sold in the summer of 2006.  With a portion of the proceeds from the harvest, she plans to repay the majority of the loan principal, the remainder of which will be repaid in the early fall of 2006 out of the cash flow of her business.									315	1			town	42.685833 26.329167	point	Sliven	BG	Bulgaria	500	2005-04-14 01:27:55 -0400		500	none		lender	4	0

This group of 33 will each receive $25 to plant their own share of crops. They will share the risk of the loan together with a representative being responsible for delivering the repayments.</em> <em>Since this is an agricultural loan, it will be repaid in its entirety at the end of the growing season rather than in installments.</em><br /><br />Louly Ngogom is a village of about 500 inhabitants of the Serrer ethnic group, under the leadership of Doudou D., the resident local government counsel member. Located among majestic baobab trees about 20 miles inland from the beach resort area of Mbour, Louly Ngokom is a poor village that depends on its youth in the cities to send money and rice home in the hungry months of August and September. In the summer of 2004, villagers lacked capital to buy seeds to plant their main cash crop, peanuts. For the initial lending, 15 household heads were chosen by Doudou and a counsel of village elders to receive a loan of $25 each to purchase of seeds before the planting season. After the harvest, 99.5% reimbursed the loans with an interest rate of 6%. In 2005, with continuing donations through John Fay, GENSEN and the village counsel were able to increase the loan and the number of beneficiaries to 33 persons, 17 men and 16 women selected on a rotating basis. <br /><br />In its goal of becoming a self-sufficient model village, Louly has in its favor a partnership with a new modern ecovillage group, introduced with the facilitation of the GENSEN NGO, SOS Environment. In fact, the ecovillage of Louly Ngokom consists of the existing traditional inhabitants plus this new group of about 20 incoming settlers, who already have started to employ local youth to grow organic bananas and produce and to construct modern ecological dwellings.									318	1			town	14.7333 -16.4167	point	Louly Ngogom	SN	Senegal	825	2005-04-14 01:27:55 -0400		825	none		partner	6	0

The witnesses beside her are Boubacar Sarr, President of Ecovillage Carabane, Mbaye Thior, Administrative Officer and Urbain Diatta, environment Officer. Located in the mouth of the Casamance River, Carabane is an off-shore island village with 700 year-round inhabitants. As the entry point of French rule in the Casamance Region of Senegal, and a classic mangrove ecosystem, Carabane is a natural ecotourist destination. However, tourism alone, as currently practiced, is insufficient to provide all the needs of the villagers, who also fish, grow some millet and raise small pigs. <br /><br />The beneficiaries of the loan are 20 members of the village women's group, who each received $70 in July 2005 and will reimburse their loans by the end of April, 2006. The group will use the funds for their small business, processing and marketing fish and other seafoods.									319	1			town	12.533333 -16.716667	point	Carabane	SN	Senegal	1400	2005-04-14 01:27:55 -0400		1400	none		partner	8	0

GENSEN has approved this group's request for credit and has received $100 in donations to open their account. <br /><br />Incorporated in 1994 as a Groupement d'Interet Economique or GIE, which is the smallest type of government recognized business, the group currently has 44 members. It first created, farmed and sold the produce from a communal field, using the profits to develop a small cash fund. By collecting dues of $0.20 per month from each member, the group began a rotating credit system, lending from $10 to $50 with 5% interest. They have continued this lending system, dropped the interest rate, and increased the membership dues to a dollar every 4 months. The total in the fund is about $1,200. The group has received and repaid a substantial loan from a federation of women's groups in their regional capital city of Saint Louis. <br /><br />The group also owns large cooking utensils that it rents out to members of the village for parties and ceremonies, the profits of which go back into the fund. Either as a group or through small businesses of its members Femmes de Nder cultivates sweet potatoes, harvests and processes incenses that grows as bulbous roots of an indigenous grass, raises chickens, goats, and sheep; practices local crafts, engages in commerce between Mauritania and Senegal and operates small restaurants. Each year, the group also pays for 4 members to go on a religious pilgrimage to Tivaouane, the holy city of their Muslim religious brotherhood.									320	1			town	16.255 -15.887222	point	Nder	SN	Senegal	1000	2005-04-14 01:27:55 -0400		1000	none		partner	9	0

He is Acholi and is one of the many thousands of people who were forced to flee their homes in the North because of the war that has been going on for the last 20 years.  His family lives in an Internally Displaced People's camp in the outskirts of Kampala called the Acholi Quarter. Six months ago J. joined Life in Africa and has been an active member ever since.  He started as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project but his hard work and determination quickly earned him a promotion to a sanding processor. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHe has acquired a piece of land from the King of Buganda who has sympathy for the people of Acholi and who has set aside free land for them.  Knowing that the people of the Acholi quarter have to go long distances to look for water, he has a plan to install a water tap on his land. The current water sellers who bring water in to this hilltop area are charging five shillings per litre for water which makes it very hard for the people to purchase water for their needs.  With a water tap installed on his land, J. will be able to purchase water for only one shilling per litre and he plans on selling this water for a reduced rate of  3 shillings per litre to his community.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nNot only will this provide a steady income for his family needs, but it will also offer a valuable service to his community at a more affordable price than they can currently get. This will insure that he has a secure source of buyers for his water, and it is likely to have a great impact on those living in the Acholi quarters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this project, J. is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475).  He es-timates that once he acquires this loan it will take approximately one week to have the water tap installed.  Below is his budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n16 metal pipes @ 12000= each =192000=<br>\r\nconnection fee to national water=300000=<br>\r\nlabor charges & other expenses =200000=<br>\r\nbuilding of small house so that the tap can be locked to avoid theft =100000=<br>\r\nThe whole total is 792000=.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on his current income, J. will be able to repay this loan in 12 months. J. loves music and dance, and has designated the community impact portion of the interest he pays to support Life in Africa's Talent Discovery program.									438	1			town	0.315556 32.565556	point	Kampala	UG	Uganda	475	2005-04-14 01:27:55 -0400		475	none		lender	5	0

This method worked but it was a very slow process and she found she was not able to make the peanut butter fast enough to earn adequate money. To remedy this, she carefully planned and saved to purchase a processing machine. This enabled her to process enough to meet the de-mands of her customers and her business grew.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut her good business sense tells her that she can do more.  She now has the capability of pro-ducing large quantities but still must produce smaller batches because she has no way of storing it until it is sold.  This will require the purchase of a refrigerator which will allow her to always have a supply on hand and will also enable her to increase her number of customers. To accomplish this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000us. This amount will purchase a refrigerator, additional packing materials needed and the necessary capital to expand her production.  \r\nBelow is her budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n 800,000/= LOAN BUDGET<br>\r\nFRIDGE 400,000=<br>\r\nPACKING MATERIALS 200,000=<br>\r\nADDITIONAL CAPITAL 200,000=<br>\r\nTOTAL 800,000=<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on her current income, Grace will be able to repay the loan in 6 months.

When her husband died unexpectedly she had just given birth to the third child and she was left with the sole responsibility of providing for herself and her children. This is no easy task for a woman in Uganda but Zarina was determined and remarkably managed to obtain a job as a housekeeper in Kampala. It was through this job that she was introduced to Life in Africa and she has been an active member for the last five years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZarina saw value in building rental properties as a way to provide for her children's education. She managed to secure several loans through Life in Africa and built a solid housing unit in a poor section of Kampala. She has several tenants living in her property now and she was able to responsibly pay back all her loans.  She earns an income from this property of shs. 200,000 ($111) each month. But the house is not yet plastered. She wants to finish the outside properly now to ensure that her tenants have quality housing for their families and to insure the value and durability of her investment.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZarina is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475) to complete the plastering of the property.

His hope is to eventually return to University for further studies, but in Peterâ€™s family itâ€™s become urgent that he starts to think about finding a wife â€“ two of his younger brothers have serious girlfriends they would like to marry, but it is against custom for them to marry before their older brothers do.  With his recent promotion, Peter also believes itâ€™s time he started to think seriously about his future, and a wife is definitely part of the plan. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Uganda, however, marriage is not a day long event but a long process that begins at the point Peter finds himself now. Since itâ€™s taboo for any girl Peter brings home to enter his fatherâ€™s house, the first thing that must happen is that Peter builds a house of his own on his fatherâ€™s land in Tororo (Eastern Uganda). Peter has been saving for this purpose and would like a loan of shs. 800,000 ($475) to add to what he has saved and complete the house quickly. <br><br>\r\n\r\nPeter is an extremely sincere, hardworking and capable young man, and very popular with the Life in Africa members - who are all now wondering who his choice of bride will be!<br><br>\r\n\r\nBelow is Peterâ€™s budget: <br>\r\n\r\nCement 20 Bags @ 17000 = 52000 <br>\r\nSand 2 Trips @ 30000 = 60000 <br>\r\nDoors 4 @ 50000 = 200000 <br>\r\nWindows 4 @ 15000 = 60000<br> \r\nNails 4kg @ 4000 = 16000<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on his current income, Peter will be able to repay this loan in 8 months.

She is loved and respected by all who work with her. <br><br>\r\n\r\n5 years ago, Monica's husband died of injuries he suffered in a trucking accident. After he died, his family came and claimed all his property, including their family home, leaving Monica and her children left on the street to start life over from scratch. This sort of thing happens far too often in Uganda and there was nothing legal that Monica could do. When she found her way to Life in Af-rica she was destitute, but realized that she could learn new skills that might improve her situation.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMonica learned quickly and worked hard. She is now the Manager of the Life in Africa WE Center and earns a steady income. Her children are all in school and their lives have greatly improved.

Monica feels it's important to give her children a home that no one can take away from them or evict them from.<br><br>\r\n\r\nShe has sold some property her family owned in her village and has managed to buy a plot of land in Kireka on the outskirts of Kampala. Here she plans to build a solid family home. She has carefully planned and the project will be completed in three years using money she saves from her salary and a series of loans. The total budget for the house she wishes to build is shs. 13,000,000 ($7220).<br><br>\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan in the amount of shs 800,000 ($475) for the first phase.

She joined through the Acholi Quarter Satelite Center. She moved to Kampala from the Gulu in the North to escape the war but she does not live in the quarters. However, she went there each day to work in the rock quarry. This was very hard on her since she had no money for transport and this forced her to walk 3 kms each way. She earned barely enough money to survive on but she had no choice since the survival of her family depended on what she could earn. Many days they had no food and they lived under the constant threat from the landlord of being thrown out of their home.</p> <p>Grace's move to Kampala also has another reason. While still in the North, Grace and her husband had divorced and she was left with her eight children to fend for themselves.</p> <p>Life in Africa has given Grace and her family new hope. The association with others and the sharing of knowledge and skills has given Grace the idea and desire to start a business. School fees for eight children is almost impossible and she worries, especially about the older girls. Her plan is to open a maize flour shop near her home. She has a 25 year old daughter who will work the shop. I talked to the daughter is she is very excited. It will not only give her work to do but she is happy that she will be earning money to help her mother and perhaps help pay school fees for her siblings. For this project Grace is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.</p> <p>Below is her budget in full:</p> <p>1- Maize 10 bags  @  50,000/=  --------------------- 500,000/=</p> <p>2- Grinding 10 bags @  6,000/= ---------           60,000/=</p> <p>3 - Rent  for 3 months  @ 50,000/=  ---------     150,000/=</p> <p>4- Transport   ---------------------------------------   90,000/=</p> <p>TOTAL        --------------------------------    800,000/=</p> <p>Grace plans that with all she will save, she can send all her children back to school.</p> <p>Grace's loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her community of peers at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala.

Irene is an active member of Life in Africa working in the invisible Bracelet project as a bracelet maker. Before coming to LIA, she earned her living working in the stone quarry near the Acholi quarters.</p> <p>She was forced to flee Northern Uganda because of the war and, as most displaced Acholi, she settled in the displaced persons camp. Life there is very hard and basic needs are hard to come by. One such need is water. There are few tap water supplies and this makes it very expensive for the people to get water and they have to walk very far.</p> <p>Her plan is to install a water tap in the part of the quarter where she lives. She will be able to provide the water at a less expensive rate and it will also benefit the community by shortening the distance they have to travel to get water. There has recently been another installation of a successful water tap but the quarters are very large and one tap will not fill the needs of so many people. This will give her a strong customer base and make it a profitable business venture. For this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000/=. She will be able to repay the loan in 12 months at a rate of 66,667/= per month. Once cash is at hand, the whole processes to have tap water is only one to two weeks.</p> <p>Below is her break down:</p> <p>35 pieces of metallic pipes @ 10,000         =350,000/=</p> <p>Labor charges ………………………         300,000/=</p> <p>Construction of shelter against wastages….100,000/=</p> <p>Charges from national water authority ……30,000/=</p> <p>Transport……………………………………10,000/=</p> <p>Other ……………………………………….10,000/=</p> <p>The total amount is 800,000/=</p> <p>Irene's loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala.

Being poor and a single mother is very difficult but she works hard in spite of the challenges to provide for her children and give them the education she never had.</p> <p>She works for Invisible Children Crew as a bracelet maker. This helps her provide for the basics at home and even pay school fees for her children. Her son will be joining Kyambogo University this coming year. The greatest challenge she has, is having no house in the village. She had to leave her children in the village with her family while she came to Kampala to earn money. When she goes to the village to visit them, she has to share a room with her brothers. It is not easy to get one family to share their home with another family when they are already crowded. In Kampala she is only able to rent one small room for herself and she dreams of the day when she will be reunited with her children.</p> <p>Her plan is to build a house in the village where her children will live comfortably and where she will stay on her visits. Her son and her brother will supervise the construction for her. She owns two cows which she plans to sell. They are worth 900,000/=. In addition to this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000/= to complete the project. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.

She started as a volunteer working in the arts and crafts center and then moved to a paying job working with the Invisible Children Bracelet project. She enjoys working on this project and at LiA because it offers the workers a way out of poverty. She is a single woman living on her own without the help of her family and her salary sustains her.</p><p>She has been fortunate to be able to live with friends who agreed to help her. Out of kindness toward her they have not charged her any rent. But she knows that this cannot continue since their own situation is very unstable. While she is very grateful for their kindness, she is now looking for a way to provide housing for herself as well as to add to her income. She has realized that housing is in great demand all the time in Kampala and she has decided to invest in property for herself and to rent out for income.</p><p>The first phase of this project will be to secure a plot of land. She has found the plot she wants and she has successfully negotiated a deal with the landowner. If she can come up with the money needed by the end of June he will sell her the property. Once she has paid for the land, she will then build a house on it to live in and also apartments that she will rent out. In this way she will be able to secure her future. To succeed at this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000 to add to the 2,200,000 that she has managed to save herself. She will be able to repay this loan in 10 months.</p><p>This is her budget: Land Aqcuisition --- 800,000/= Total 800,000/=</p><p>WE Team to benefit: integrated Adult Education </p>									616	1			town	0.315556 32.565556	point	Kampala	UG	Uganda	450	2006-06-13 02:40:08 -0400	USD	450	none		partner	3	0

She is Acholi and originally lived in the Pader District in Northern Uganda. It was there that the rebels attacked her village and abducted two of her children. Her children were gone for two years but were finally rescued by government troups and were returned to her in the camp she fled to in Kampala. Rose and her husband both started working in the stone quarry but they were not able to earn enough to sustain the family. When she joined LiA their lives took a turn for the better. They have more money and they have been able to save enough to build a modest home which also helps financially since they no longer have to pay rent.</p><p>Their plan now is to enlarge the stone quarry work that her husband still does. By making it their own business they will be able to hire others so her husband does not have to do all the work himself and their production will increase giving them more income.

As a very observant person she has studied her community to see what services she could provide.</p><p>As a result of her observations, she decided that the people living in the camp need to raise their self esteem. They need to be as smartly dressed and groomed as any other people living in Kampala. To this end she plans to open a men's saloon (barber shop). Her husband who currently toils in the rock quarry would run the business while she continues with her work at LiA.</p><p>Her plans include erecting a small room adjacent to her house where there is power available. She also will purchase a small generator so that the business can still run even with the current power crisis in Uganda.
