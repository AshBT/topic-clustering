121	Fish mongering is a great business right now in Uganda and Kiva is supporting many in this business currently. \r\n<br><br>\r\nPeninah, like Eunice Okepa, plans to hire a truck to go to Lake Victoria and buy fish for herself there.  This is much less expensive than buying fish in her rural village.  This loan will enable her to travel this long distance so she can bring lower prices to her village.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMost fish mongers in the village get their fish from middlemen at much higher prices.  This loan will enable her to take a step most don't have the opportunity to take -- cutting out the middleman.  She will get the fish smoked, in bulk, so that she can continue selling for a number of days.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPeninah is a proven businesswoman.  She received a grant in 2001 from VEF to start her small business.  She has been faithful with this help, and now is ready to take it to the next level.

He has started with lower quality goats and now he is ready to move on to the top breeds in larger sizes.  These are very hard to get, and thus it is difficult to expand your business without the help of a loan. \r\n<br><br>\r\nGiven a loan of $500, he plans to improve on his stock and also buy more improved goat breeds.  This will fetch him enough money and profit that can help him in his family and refund of the loan.

She deals in both wholesale and retail.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA loan will help Margaret significantly upgrade her store.  She is currently supporting her family with the store, but they are struggling to pay school fees and buy medicine.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGiven a loan 500 dollars, she plans to expand her business by buying the essential commodities in large quantity --  sugar, salt, bread, cooking oil, washing soap, toilet soap, rice, baking powder, baking flour, matches etc.\r\n<br><br>

Swahili is the main language in Tanzania, and Imani means "faith" in Swahili.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDodoma is one of the largest towns in Tanzania which has recently been named the capital of the country.  However, currently much of the Tz government still resides in Dar es Salaam near the coast. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThose in the villages surrounding Dodoma are very poor and have no means of transportation other than walking.  For this reason, it is very important that shops open up inside the villages so that the villagers do not need to walk far to get supplies.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nMathayo with his group they have retail shop selling Sugar, soap,cookng oil, used clothes, rice pens and other items.  The business is making profit which supporting their families paying school fees for their Children, medication, food and clothing. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf they can get the loan they will be able to get  more profit for pay back the loan and more profit for their own family use.

He has been buying fish from Mtera, which is 130 km away and selling the fishes in Dodoma town.  He has a small staff who sell fish with him.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is a large demand for fish in Dodoma, but it is difficult to find them, for sellers must travel a a long distance to the lake or coast.  Dodoma is a landlocked town. Most local sellers must purchase fish from a middle man. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe business started with grant of Tsh 80.000.00 and now the business has reached a value of Tsh 500,000.00, which is over ($400).  This loan will be a huge boost for Peter to rapidly accelerate the business.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe main use of the profits from the business will be to send their children to school and meet other family needs.  Altogether, this loan will help send 20 children to school.

Currently, the business value is Tsh. 400,000.\r\nCurrently, one US dollar is worth 1,174.90 Tanzanian Shillings.  Thus, the value of this business is now over $300 US.  Maintaining cash in a business is important for future purchasing.  A loan will highly accelerate the possibilities for this group.  Meru has a small staff and it has been observed that they are a very successful  team and that is why they now qualify for this loan from Kiva.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe used clothing business is very successful in Tanzania, as it is in all of East Africa.  Many East Africans have found great use for used clothing from Europe and America.  It is less expensive than African clothing and of pretty high quality.  Thus, you can see many Tanzanias walking around wearing t-shirts displaying American brands, schools, regions, performers and sports teams.  This is just a reality here.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe loan will expand the business by openning a small shop for selling more clothes also she will be able to go to Dar-es-salaam to buy stock for the business and the business.  The ability to travel this far will set them apart here in Dodoma, for most locals do not have the opportunity to make such a long voyage for business.  This will allow them to buy the clothes as they come straight into the country from foreign lands.

She has run her own tailoring shop in the center of the town for the past three years, and lives in a small village on the outskirts of town with her husband and two small children.  She mends and makes simple clothes for people in the neighborhood. However, her primary sewing machine has become unreliable and she does not have the financial ability to purchase a new one.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nWith this loan, she plans to do two things.  First, she will purchase a new sewing machine.  Secondly, she will fix up the back of her store where people will be able to try on the clothes she alters or makes for them.  The flexibility of the Kiva loan has special significance for Zara, given her familyâ€™s situation.  Her husband, who has been unable to find outside employment, tends to the familyâ€™s garden, the produce of which will be sold in the summer of 2006.  With a portion of the proceeds from the harvest, she plans to repay the majority of the loan principal, the remainder of which will be repaid in the early fall of 2006 out of the cash flow of her business.
152	<em>This is a group loan. This group of 33 will each receive $25 to plant their own share of crops. They will share the risk of the loan together with a representative being responsible for delivering the repayments.</em> <em>Since this is an agricultural loan, it will be repaid in its entirety at the end of the growing season rather than in installments.</em><br /><br />Louly Ngogom is a village of about 500 inhabitants of the Serrer ethnic group, under the leadership of Doudou D., the resident local government counsel member. Located among majestic baobab trees about 20 miles inland from the beach resort area of Mbour, Louly Ngokom is a poor village that depends on its youth in the cities to send money and rice home in the hungry months of August and September. In the summer of 2004, villagers lacked capital to buy seeds to plant their main cash crop, peanuts. For the initial lending, 15 household heads were chosen by Doudou and a counsel of village elders to receive a loan of $25 each to purchase of seeds before the planting season. After the harvest, 99.5% reimbursed the loans with an interest rate of 6%. In 2005, with continuing donations through John Fay, GENSEN and the village counsel were able to increase the loan and the number of beneficiaries to 33 persons, 17 men and 16 women selected on a rotating basis. <br /><br />In its goal of becoming a self-sufficient model village, Louly has in its favor a partnership with a new modern ecovillage group, introduced with the facilitation of the GENSEN NGO, SOS Environment. In fact, the ecovillage of Louly Ngokom consists of the existing traditional inhabitants plus this new group of about 20 incoming settlers, who already have started to employ local youth to grow organic bananas and produce and to construct modern ecological dwellings.
153	<em>This is a group loan where 20 people get $70 loans and share the risk.

The witnesses beside her are Boubacar Sarr, President of Ecovillage Carabane, Mbaye Thior, Administrative Officer and Urbain Diatta, environment Officer. Located in the mouth of the Casamance River, Carabane is an off-shore island village with 700 year-round inhabitants. As the entry point of French rule in the Casamance Region of Senegal, and a classic mangrove ecosystem, Carabane is a natural ecotourist destination. However, tourism alone, as currently practiced, is insufficient to provide all the needs of the villagers, who also fish, grow some millet and raise small pigs. <br /><br />The beneficiaries of the loan are 20 members of the village women's group, who each received $70 in July 2005 and will reimburse their loans by the end of April, 2006. The group will use the funds for their small business, processing and marketing fish and other seafoods.
154	<em>This is a group loan where a group of women will share the risk of the loan together. A representative, Fatoumata D., will deliver the repayment.</em> <em>Please note: The agreement with the Femmes de Nder group was that they would repay the entire Kiva loan at the end of the borrowing period (January 2007) rather than in installments.  This is because the group leader wishes to give each member the opportunity to borrow a small portion of the total loan amount for her own business activities, for a length of time that is less than the total nine-month term of the Kiva loan.  The individual will then repay the loan she has taken to the group fund, which will in turn lend it to another member.  Allowing the group to repay the entire loan at the end of the borrowing period in this way allows them to take turns borrowing, extending access to more members.</em><br /><br />« Femmes de Nder » is the women's group of the 300 person village of Nder in the north of Senegal near the Mauritanian border, also known as the ancient capital of the Walo, one of the Kingdoms of the Wolof ethnic group, conquered by the French. GENSEN has approved this group's request for credit and has received $100 in donations to open their account. <br /><br />Incorporated in 1994 as a Groupement d'Interet Economique or GIE, which is the smallest type of government recognized business, the group currently has 44 members. It first created, farmed and sold the produce from a communal field, using the profits to develop a small cash fund. By collecting dues of $0.20 per month from each member, the group began a rotating credit system, lending from $10 to $50 with 5% interest. They have continued this lending system, dropped the interest rate, and increased the membership dues to a dollar every 4 months. The total in the fund is about $1,200. The group has received and repaid a substantial loan from a federation of women's groups in their regional capital city of Saint Louis. <br /><br />The group also owns large cooking utensils that it rents out to members of the village for parties and ceremonies, the profits of which go back into the fund. Either as a group or through small businesses of its members Femmes de Nder cultivates sweet potatoes, harvests and processes incenses that grows as bulbous roots of an indigenous grass, raises chickens, goats, and sheep; practices local crafts, engages in commerce between Mauritania and Senegal and operates small restaurants. Each year, the group also pays for 4 members to go on a religious pilgrimage to Tivaouane, the holy city of their Muslim religious brotherhood.

164	I have spent the last years as a door to door salesman but my enterprising spirit inspires me to have my own ice cream agency, in addition I am very proud to generate job opportunities in a country like Nicaragua where they do not arise easily. \r\n\r\nHaving my own agency will allow me to obtain greater income and to improve the standard of life of my family and the people to whom it benefits with the jobs
165	I have been selling fresh and frozen chickens for 5 years out of my house.  For years, I only sold fresh chickens which I would buy from my auntâ€™s chicken farm.   Then, I used my first loans to buy freezers, which really improved my business.  Now I do much more business and I invest larger amounts in chickens.
166	The bus stop outside of my house is very busy and I have used it to build a strong business over the past 10 years.  Even with two helpers, I am always on my feet.
167	I have been running my store for 2 years, and I have been successfully partly because I have two Atari videogame consoles which the local kids like to play.  My store is busy.
168	I sell my products in small stores and businesses around our bakery, also, some of my clients place orders with me for celebrations and other events. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe credit will help me to construct a new oven and to improve my Bakery in order to increase my production and my income.
169	After three years in business, I have good customers.  They know I will find them the kind of cloths they like at the right price, so they return to my shop.  The better my inventory, the more I sell.
170	I have been making shoes and repairing them for 11 years.  This is the first time I have ever taken a loan to invest in my business.  My plan is to buy in bulk the basic tools and materials that I always buy.  My customers come to my shop to place their orders or leave me their shoes.  My shop is in a good and easy location for my customers.
174	I have had a clothing shop in the Municipal Market of Danli for 15 years.  I am the head of my family and the shop has always been my business.\r\n\r\nThe clothing I sell is used clothing from the United States.  I buy the clothes in bulk and then sell it in my little shop.
181	I have a shop in the San Juan market in Siguatepeque.  I have been working for a couple years, and I enjoy running my shop very much.  I want to increase my inventory to better serve my clients.
183	I am a baker who can do all kids of baking to meet the needs of my customers.  Honduras has many delicious baked goods to try such as Rosquillas (corn and cheese donuts), tustacas (corn cookies with raw cane sugar), vanilla cookes and semitas (another cookie).<br/><br/>  \r\n\r\nHowever, my specialty which I am well-known for, is cakes and sweets.  My most popular product is birthday cakes, which are ordered by my clients a few days before the birthday party.
185	My restaurant is in a good location, and I have been serving people for many years.  This business has enabled me to provide for my children, and I am grateful for the progress of my business.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHere is a recipe from Honduras:\r\n<br><br>\r\nHonduran Pollo Con Salsa (Chicken In Sauce)<br><br>\r\n3 1/2  \t lbs   frying chicken, whole<br>\r\n1/4 \tcup cooking oil<br>\r\n1/8-1/2 \tteaspoon hot chili powder<br>\r\n1/4 \tcup ground sesame seeds<br>\r\n3 \twhole cloves<br>\r\n1 \tcinnamon stick<br>\r\n1 \tteaspoon brown sugar<br>\r\n1/4 \tteaspoon fenugreek seeds<br>\r\n1/2 \tteaspoon salt<br>\r\n1/4 \tteaspoon pepper<br>\r\n2 \tcups boiling water<br>\r\n2 \ttomatoes, chopped<br>\r\n1 \tgreen pepper, chopped<br>\r\n1 \tonion, chopped<br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<ol><li>Brown chicken in oil on all sides; remove from pot.\r\n<li>Add chili powder, sesame seeds, cloves, cinnamon, brown sugar, fenugreek, and salt and pepper; brown in oil.\r\n<li>Add remaining ingredients.\r\n<li>Simmer until tender.\r\n<li>Add chicken and cook until tender, turning occasionally.\r\n<li>Add more water if necessary.</ol>

187	My customers know that I will make arrangements to their liking.  They come to my house to order arrangments for weddings, sweet fifteen parties, birthdays, and holidays.
188	I started my business just as a take-out restaurant for local <i> catrachos</i>*, but I have expanded to sell other packaged products that my customers want.   I think my business is successful because my customers like how I treat them. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n*A Honduran can be called a Catracho or Catracha. The comes from the last name of Honduran General Florencio Xatruch, who led Honduran armed forces in defense of Honduran territories in 1857 against an attempted invasion led by a North American named William Walker. The nickname is considered complimentary, not derogatory so when you come to Graciela's we will say `Hola <i>catracho!</i>
189	I sell clothes for children, ladies, and gentlemen.  I walk door to door around the city to visit my regular clients.  On the weekends, I travel to neighboring towns to sell.   \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you go to Honduras, your eyes will see something that will catch your attention - a great variety of typical dresses. This variety is composed of eight typical dresses that change depending on the occasion. In Honduras, these dresses are used to demonstrate the traditional culture, costumes, and beliefs from each region, and they are identified by their typical dresses.
190	I have two busineses which are both working well.\r\n<br><br>  \r\nMy main business is selling cosmetics from a catalog.  My clients would come to my house, select the cosmetics they wanted to purchase, and I would place the order.  As my businesses were doing well I decided to open a little store for additional income.  I have very loyal clients which has contributed to the success of my businesses.
192	My clients order Ã­tems from me when they want something pretty for their house.  I make bedspreads, pillow cases, curtains, drapes, and other Ã­tems.  Recently, I have had success selling furniture coverings door to door to shops.   I have a lot of orders pending and I need to invest in materials.  Getting this loan will help me be able to buy the materials to help a whole new set of customers.  It is difficult to grow a business without a loan, and loans are hard to get.  Thank you for your help.
193	I have had the shop for 8 years, and I have been able to grow the inventory and develop strong customer loyalty in order to provide for my whole family.  I sell shoes for the whole entire family from my shop in the San Juan market in the town of Siguatepeque.
194	I sell prepared food in the San Juan market.  In the San Juan market, fruits and vegetables are in abundance watermelons and canteloupes are available as well as pineapple, strawberries, blackberries, and papaya.  I sell prepared food which includes meat and many of these fruits and vegetables\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy work plan is to start offering a greater variety of dishes to my customers.  They have been asking me to expand my menu.  I will use the loan to purchase in larger quantities many new ingredients.
195	I sell new clothes in the San Juan market in the town of Siguatepeque, but I also sell door to door to offices and places where my regular clients live and work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSiguatepeque is a city of about 45,000 people. Located in the Central Highlands of Honduras, the climate is considerably more temperate than the coastal area and lower elevations.
196	I make my cheeses in my house with my family and then deliver them to my clients door to door in the towns of Siguatepeque and Comayagua.   My main buyers are corner stores, groceries, and restaurants.  I have been working in this business for 10 years.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe most popular kinds of Honduran cheese are fresh, white cheeses with names like `Queso Blanco`, `Panela`, `Queso Fresco`, `Queso Del Pais`, and `Queso Para Freir`. These cheeses are all made the same way and have the same eating and cooking characteristics. They have shelf-lives of less than one week and are usually wrapped in banana leaves when they are sold.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOne very interesting thing about many styles of Honduran cheese is that they do not melt when they are heated - they soften!
197	People like my food, and I like making it for them.  The happiest time in my restaurant is lunch-time when it fills up and people who know each other talk and enjoy a break before going back to work.  \r\nWe serve many traditional Honduran foods, including pinchos and refried beans.
198	I have had my barbershop for three years.  Most of the young people in the neighborhood come to me for their haircuts.  Now that my business is established, I am going to improve its appearance to give my clients an even better experience.   This will bring in a new type of client to my shop and improve it's reputation even more.
199	I sell new clothes, but my specialty is baby's clothes.  When there is a new baby born in the neighborhood, my clients tell me so I can visit the family and offer them some nice new clothes for the baby to wear.  \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nI sell my new clothes door to door in the sorrounding communities where my clients live.

234	For the past 4 years Iâ€™ve dedicated myself to the sale of clothing and shoes for children, women and men. I sell my products to various offices in this city.  I already have a set clientele and I get paid every 15 days or upon delivery. I also sell from my residence with the help of my kids.  This business generates some earnings that allow me to better provide for my household.
235	My name is Santos Casco and I make and sell delicious nacatamelas, one of our typical foods.  In the last months my business has grown since I have received many more orders.  My business clients say that the flavour of my nacatamales is unique which is made better by my kind, charming customer service.  I also sell my nacatamales to my neighbours.
236	I bake and sell bread (rosquillas and quesadillas) and receive orders from my clients, housewives or owners of small grocery shops. I have done this for the past three years and with the help of one of my sons Iâ€™ve managed to grow significantly.  My demand is now so large that I need to buy more ingredients.
237	My name is Dirminda Sorto, I am the owner of a mill that grinds corn for household production and consumption of tortillas. Iâ€™ve had my mill for the past 13 years, and since itâ€™s the only mill in my community I have a lot of clients, therefore it has deteriorated.  The mill is one of the primary income sources of my family. I would like a credit in order to buy an electric mill and be able to continue with my business. Also, during school session, I sell candy to the students in my community and at the entrance of the school.
238	I am the owner of a small grocery shop that sells basic staples and other popular products such as milk, bread, lard, soda, candies amongst others. Iâ€™ve had my business for the past two years and itâ€™s the only shop in my community. Because of this I have a high demand and I need to restock with products that will be easily sold. I use the earnings from my store in order to keep my children in primary and secondary school.
239	I am the owner of a carpentry shop that builds beds, doors, wardrobes, dinning tables, chairs amongst others. I have lots of clients and most of my work is done by order.  I get paid 50% when we sign the contract and 50% when I hand them the final product, which makes it harder for me to sell furniture to other clients. This area has lots of demand for the elaboration of furniture and wood therefore I decided to work with PRISMA.
240	Iâ€™ve had my shop for the past seven years. Iâ€™ve managed to administer it and increase my number of clients.  It is my only source of income so I take care of my sales. I am a single mother of two. One of my sons is in school and the other is two years old. I think if I invest more capital in restocking my store Iâ€™ll get more earnings
241	My name is Angelina LÃ³pez and I sell accessories for sewing;  I also tailor clothing for women.  Iâ€™ve been tailoring for the past fifteen years and selling the accessories for the past two. I need the credit in order to buy the necessary cloth to make school uniforms.
242	I've had my business for two years.  Before my salon I worked for a private company and when I retired I invested the money in my own business. At the moment Iâ€™m working towards getting more clients and in order to do so I need to get good quality products to satisfy them.  The earnings of the salon help me with my family.
243	Both my husband and myself run the business.  We both keep the store that generates income that covers the expenses of my family. My business is one of the largest in my community and once in a while visitors ask me to cook for them, which provides some extra earnings.
244	I sell popular medicines for headache, diarrhea, fleas, stomach aches amongst others.  I sell my product in neighbouring communities. My wife and my two sons sell the medicine from my house. Iâ€™ve had this business for the past two years.  My wife also sells products from catalogues. The main source of income in my household is the medicines.
245	For the past 5 years Iâ€™ve had my store. I have a lot of clients because of the great diversity of products that I offer.  Iâ€™m located at the exit of the city and because of this I get a lot of business from the people travelling to the surrounding villages.  They buy their weekly provisions in my store. One way in which Iâ€™ve increased my sales is by allowing customers to pay every 15 days rather than on a weekly basis.
246	I own two car that I use as a taxis to provide tranportation in the city of Danily.  I work from 6:00 am â€“ 7:30 pm therefore I have to give maintenance to both my cars. I need to keep using at least one in order to retian my daily earnings.  I also need to change  the tires in the other.  In my family we are four, two kids, my wife and myself.  I mainly use the income for our everyday life.
247	I sell clothing and shoes for children, men and women.  My business is in  one of the main streets of Danili.  Iâ€™ve had my stand for the past two years and my sales are good given that my main clients are people from other communities that visit Danili.

276	Ocola J. is 52 years old and is married with 5 children. He is Acholi and is one of the many thousands of people who were forced to flee their homes in the North because of the war that has been going on for the last 20 years.  His family lives in an Internally Displaced People's camp in the outskirts of Kampala called the Acholi Quarter. Six months ago J. joined Life in Africa and has been an active member ever since.  He started as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project but his hard work and determination quickly earned him a promotion to a sanding processor. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHe has acquired a piece of land from the King of Buganda who has sympathy for the people of Acholi and who has set aside free land for them.  Knowing that the people of the Acholi quarter have to go long distances to look for water, he has a plan to install a water tap on his land. The current water sellers who bring water in to this hilltop area are charging five shillings per litre for water which makes it very hard for the people to purchase water for their needs.  With a water tap installed on his land, J. will be able to purchase water for only one shilling per litre and he plans on selling this water for a reduced rate of  3 shillings per litre to his community.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nNot only will this provide a steady income for his family needs, but it will also offer a valuable service to his community at a more affordable price than they can currently get. This will insure that he has a secure source of buyers for his water, and it is likely to have a great impact on those living in the Acholi quarters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this project, J. is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475).  He es-timates that once he acquires this loan it will take approximately one week to have the water tap installed.  Below is his budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n16 metal pipes @ 12000= each =192000=<br>\r\nconnection fee to national water=300000=<br>\r\nlabor charges & other expenses =200000=<br>\r\nbuilding of small house so that the tap can be locked to avoid theft =100000=<br>\r\nThe whole total is 792000=.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on his current income, J. will be able to repay this loan in 12 months. J. loves music and dance, and has designated the community impact portion of the interest he pays to support Life in Africa's Talent Discovery program.
277	Grace A. is a mother of four children and has been an active member of Life in Africa for the last four years.  Five years ago she was faced with the problem of earning enough money to support herself and her children.  As with many women in her situation, she turned to something she knew to try and earn money. She happened to know how to make good peanut butter and so she started her small business. Her main goal was to be self reliant and to serve her customers well while earning an income to support her children.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she used the age old method of grinding the nuts using a mortar and pestle.  This method worked but it was a very slow process and she found she was not able to make the peanut butter fast enough to earn adequate money. To remedy this, she carefully planned and saved to purchase a processing machine. This enabled her to process enough to meet the de-mands of her customers and her business grew.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut her good business sense tells her that she can do more.  She now has the capability of pro-ducing large quantities but still must produce smaller batches because she has no way of storing it until it is sold.  This will require the purchase of a refrigerator which will allow her to always have a supply on hand and will also enable her to increase her number of customers. To accomplish this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000us. This amount will purchase a refrigerator, additional packing materials needed and the necessary capital to expand her production.  \r\nBelow is her budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n 800,000/= LOAN BUDGET<br>\r\nFRIDGE 400,000=<br>\r\nPACKING MATERIALS 200,000=<br>\r\nADDITIONAL CAPITAL 200,000=<br>\r\nTOTAL 800,000=<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on her current income, Grace will be able to repay the loan in 6 months. She has desig-nated 1/4 of the interest she pays on this loan to support educational opportunities for Life in Af-rica member children.
278	Zarina A. is a widow with three children. When her husband died unexpectedly she had just given birth to the third child and she was left with the sole responsibility of providing for herself and her children.

It was through this job that she was introduced to Life in Africa and she has been an active member for the last five years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZarina saw value in building rental properties as a way to provide for her children's education. She managed to secure several loans through Life in Africa and built a solid housing unit in a poor section of Kampala. She has several tenants living in her property now and she was able to responsibly pay back all her loans.  She earns an income from this property of shs. 200,000 ($111) each month. But the house is not yet plastered. She wants to finish the outside properly now to ensure that her tenants have quality housing for their families and to insure the value and durability of her investment.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZarina is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475) to complete the plastering of the property. Her budget is listed below.<br><br>\r\n\r\n20 bags of cement @ 17000=  340000=<br>\r\nsand                                      80000=<br>\r\nlabor                                     300000=<br>\r\ntransport                                 50000=<br>\r\nother expenses                        30000=<br>\r\nTotal                                       800000=<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on her current income, Zarina will be able to pay off this loan in 4 months.

279	Peter has just been promoted to Foreman at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala. His hope is to eventually return to University for further studies, but in Peterâ€™s family itâ€™s become urgent that he starts to think about finding a wife â€“ two of his younger brothers have serious girlfriends they would like to marry, but it is against custom for them to marry before their older brothers do.  With his recent promotion, Peter also believes itâ€™s time he started to think seriously about his future, and a wife is definitely part of the plan. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Uganda, however, marriage is not a day long event but a long process that begins at the point Peter finds himself now. Since itâ€™s taboo for any girl Peter brings home to enter his fatherâ€™s house, the first thing that must happen is that Peter builds a house of his own on his fatherâ€™s land in Tororo (Eastern Uganda). Peter has been saving for this purpose and would like a loan of shs. 800,000 ($475) to add to what he has saved and complete the house quickly. <br><br>\r\n\r\nPeter is an extremely sincere, hardworking and capable young man, and very popular with the Life in Africa members - who are all now wondering who his choice of bride will be!<br><br>\r\n\r\nBelow is Peterâ€™s budget: <br>\r\n\r\nCement 20 Bags @ 17000 = 52000 <br>\r\nSand 2 Trips @ 30000 = 60000 <br>\r\nDoors 4 @ 50000 = 200000 <br>\r\nWindows 4 @ 15000 = 60000<br> \r\nNails 4kg @ 4000 = 16000<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on his current income, Peter will be able to repay this loan in 8 months.

He has proved himself to be a very hard worker as a sander and bracelet maker for the Invisible Children Bracelet project.</p><p>Fred is a father of four children. It is very expensive raising children and providing them with school fees, food, medical care and housing.

His family currently lives in one of the houses and he rents out the other two. But the houses are only partly finished and so he can only charge a small rent.

She is one of the younger members being only 20 years old. She is an orphan. Her parents died when she was only 8 leaving her and her two brothers alone.</p> <p>They were taken in by an aunt but life was very hard. The aunt, who was a widow herself, was taking care of many children and the grandmother who is blind. With very little money, food was often scarce and the only schooling Monica could afford was a tailor course. She did manage to get a job but could not earn enough money to exist on. Then she came to LiA. She now earns enough to help with food, rent, school fees for her brothers and support for her grandmother.</p> <p>With encouragement from her determined aunt, she is learning to be independent and to forget that she is an orphan. She has managed to save enough to set up a small shop. Her cousin runs the shop during the day while Monica works. Now she would like to do more. If she adds more stock to the shop, her profits will increase. She also plans to use her tailoring skills by purchasing a sewing machine. Since her shop has a big veranda, she will put this sewing machine there and use on the weekends to earn money. For this project she is seeking a loan of 800,000/=. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months at a rate of 66,667/= per month.</p> <p>Below is her budget:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"><li>A sewing machine @ …………. 250, 000/=</li><li>adding stock:</li></ol> <ul class="simple"><li>100kgs of rice @ 900/= ………………90,000/=</li><li>50kgs of sugar ……………………70,000/=</li><li>20 liters of cooking oil…………….40, 000/=</li><li>100kgs of maize flour @ 600/=……60,000/=</li><li>60kgs of beans @ 1,000/=………….60,000/=</li><li>50kgs of groundnuts @ 2,000/=…….100,000/=</li><li>50kgs of Simsim @ 1,500/=  …………75,000/=</li><li>1 box of washing soap ………………...25,000/=</li><li>Transport ………………………………30,000/=</li></ul> <p>The total is 800,000/=</p> <p>Monica's loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala.

382	<p>Grace is an active member of Life in Africa. She joined through the Acholi Quarter Satelite Center. She moved to Kampala from the Gulu in the North to escape the war but she does not live in the quarters. However, she went there each day to work in the rock quarry. This was very hard on her since she had no money for transport and this forced her to walk 3 kms each way. She earned barely enough money to survive on but she had no choice since the survival of her family depended on what she could earn. Many days they had no food and they lived under the constant threat from the landlord of being thrown out of their home.</p> <p>Grace's move to Kampala also has another reason. While still in the North, Grace and her husband had divorced and she was left with her eight children to fend for themselves.</p> <p>Life in Africa has given Grace and her family new hope. The association with others and the sharing of knowledge and skills has given Grace the idea and desire to start a business. School fees for eight children is almost impossible and she worries, especially about the older girls. Her plan is to open a maize flour shop near her home. She has a 25 year old daughter who will work the shop. I talked to the daughter is she is very excited. It will not only give her work to do but she is happy that she will be earning money to help her mother and perhaps help pay school fees for her siblings. For this project Grace is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.</p> <p>Below is her budget in full:</p> <p>1- Maize 10 bags  @  50,000/=  --------------------- 500,000/=</p> <p>2- Grinding 10 bags @  6,000/= ---------           60,000/=</p> <p>3 - Rent  for 3 months  @ 50,000/=  ---------     150,000/=</p> <p>4- Transport   ---------------------------------------   90,000/=</p> <p>TOTAL        --------------------------------    800,000/=</p> <p>Grace plans that with all she will save, she can send all her children back to school.</p> <p>Grace's loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her community of peers at the Life in Africa WE Center in Kampala.

383	<p>L. Irene is an active member of Life in Africa working in the invisible Bracelet project as a bracelet maker. Before coming to LIA, she earned her living working in the stone quarry near the Acholi quarters.</p> <p>She was forced to flee Northern Uganda because of the war and, as most displaced Acholi, she settled in the displaced persons camp. Life there is very hard and basic needs are hard to come by. One such need is water. There are few tap water supplies and this makes it very expensive for the people to get water and they have to walk very far.</p> <p>Her plan is to install a water tap in the part of the quarter where she lives. She will be able to provide the water at a less expensive rate and it will also benefit the community by shortening the distance they have to travel to get water. There has recently been another installation of a successful water tap but the quarters are very large and one tap will not fill the needs of so many people. This will give her a strong customer base and make it a profitable business venture. For this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000/=. She will be able to repay the loan in 12 months at a rate of 66,667/= per month. Once cash is at hand, the whole processes to have tap water is only one to two weeks.</p> <p>Below is her break down:</p> <p>35 pieces of metallic pipes @ 10,000         =350,000/=</p> <p>Labor charges ………………………         300,000/=</p> <p>Construction of shelter against wastages….100,000/=</p> <p>Charges from national water authority ……30,000/=</p> <p>Transport……………………………………10,000/=</p> <p>Other ……………………………………….10,000/=</p> <p>The total amount is 800,000/=</p> <p>Irene's loan has been reviewed and guaranteed by her peers at the Life in Africa WE Center community in Kampala.

Being poor and a single mother is very difficult but she works hard in spite of the challenges to provide for her children and give them the education she never had.</p> <p>She works for Invisible Children Crew as a bracelet maker. This helps her provide for the basics at home and even pay school fees for her children. Her son will be joining Kyambogo University this coming year. The greatest challenge she has, is having no house in the village. She had to leave her children in the village with her family while she came to Kampala to earn money. When she goes to the village to visit them, she has to share a room with her brothers. It is not easy to get one family to share their home with another family when they are already crowded. In Kampala she is only able to rent one small room for herself and she dreams of the day when she will be reunited with her children.</p> <p>Her plan is to build a house in the village where her children will live comfortably and where she will stay on her visits. Her son and her brother will supervise the construction for her. She owns two cows which she plans to sell. They are worth 900,000/=. In addition to this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 500,000/= to complete the project. She will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.

4652	R. is 32 years old, and is married with two children, both girls aged 15 and 10. The eldest is attending senior high school, while the younger one is in elementary school. Her husband, Salim, does not have a fixed job, so he does odd jobs, carrying goods and off-loading trucks when he can.\r\n\r\nR. buys waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Their own working capital is limited, at around $250. Having heard from her friends about MBK, R. has now applied to MBK to add to her working capital. Since this is the first time, R. can only borrow a maximum of $75 from MBK.\r\n\r\nThe recycling business consists of the following chain. R. and her husband are the first link in this chair, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them, before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted-out material and takes it to the warehouse dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of R.’s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste material to various processing factories, which turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by R. and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills.

5056	Jane Wangari, aged 50 years, is recently widowed, having lost her husband in January 2007. She has two children and two grand-children, who all depend on her, because her children are only able to get casual jobs once in a while. Jane sells cooked foods, within the Kiambiu slums, including beans, black beans and githeri, a mixture of maize and beans boiled together.\r\n\r\nJane previously had an embroidery business which collapsed after one of her sons was involved in a road accident, where she spent all she had including business money on his medical expenses. This son eventually died, leaving Jane and her other children absolutely poor. Jane had previously borrowed some money from one of the big Micro-finance institutions in Kenya, to enable her to run this business. Due to the medical problem in the family, she was unable to continue with the loan repayments, hence could not borrow again, since she was now viewed as a risky client.  \r\n\r\nJane started off her current business in early 2006, after she borrowed a tin of beans from a businessman, who allowed her to cook and sell the beans, then later make the payments for the borrowed tin of beans.  From the same proceeds, she managed to buy her first tin of beans, which she continued to cook, hence setting up the business. Jane is now a member of the Vumilia group of Action Now Kenya, in the Kiambiu slums, where she has so far accessed two levels of loans, of Usd. 57 and Usd. 85, both of which she used to increase her stock, and which she has since repaid successfully. \r\n\r\nCurrently Jane has only one sufuria (cooking pot) of her own, while the other two she has are borrowed, and the owner has actually been asking her to return them. Jane therefore seeks to buy two sufurias of a bigger size than what she is currently using, together with two jikos (cooking stoves) big enough for the pots she will buy. The biggest benefit to Jane will be that she will be able to return the borrowed pots, and also acquire bigger pots that will enable her to make more food, as is required by her customers. She also intends to introduce the sale of boiled green maize (corn) and green grams, which her customers have been requesting her to make.\r\n\r\nAs part of goodwill, Jane reserves the bean stock she gets from the boiled beans and githeri, to give to some of the women within the Kiambiu slums, who are too poor to buy food. They use this stock to make a stew for the family meal, hence their children don’t have to sleep hungry as long as Jane is there. \r\n\r\nA loan of $75 which will be given to her in kind (i.e ANK will purchase the two pots and cooking stoves for her), will assist her not only to achieve her objective of preparing more food, but will also enable her to have more stock to serve to more people in need. The repayment period for this loan will be between 4 – 8 months.

49631	“Virgen del Rosario” is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru’s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and, as a very mountainous area ranging 2,000 – 5,000 meters above sea level, has many limitations such as the cold, the difficulty to grow crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR “Virgen del Rosario” is located at approximately 2,500 meters above sea level in the community of Huanchuy, in the district of Chincho, province of Angaraes. The small town of Huanchuy is located at the border of the Cachi River and used to be an old colonial hacienda. Although the village politically belongs to the region of Huancavelica, all business is done with Ayacucho, the biggest city nearby. Most members of the group have never even been to the capital of their region!\r\n<p>\r\nThe main activities of the population are related to agriculture. The valley of Huanchuy has an excellent climate because of the relatively low altituD. and the availability of water throughout the year. The climate makes it possible to grow a great variety of products like tara and black corn and many fruits and vegetables like avocado, pacay, tuna (prickly pear cactus fruit), sugarcane, carrots, and lettuce. In higher altitudes, the population also grows potatoes. From the tuna cactus comes another product: cochinilla, a small parasite (insect) that is used for its powerful coloring for cosmetics (locals used it to paint their faces or lips in traditional festivals). Besides cultivating all of the mentioned products, most people dedicate their time to raising small animals like guinea pigs, chicken, ducks and rabbits; and bigger animals as cows and bulls. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 3,400 soles (about 1,225 US$). The loans range from 200 up to 600 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save. But all agree to save in the future for reinvestment in their businesses or maybe to buy a community sewing machine. The expectations of the members of the new village bank incluD. receiving trainings on “marketing” (how to improve their business) and learning how to weave and stitch cloths. Besides that, they think the village bank will be an excellent way to share ideas and experiences.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Nancy. Nancy will receive a loan of 600 soles and runs a small grocery store in the community. With her loan, she will increase her merchandise, buying more soft drinks, beers, sweets, fruits and other groceries. Nancy´s dream for the future is to have her own sewing business. With FINCA Peru, she wants to learn to save so that she can improve her business and help her father.\r\n<p>\r\nMaura tells another story. She sells vegetables at local weekly markets, going from one to the other. But her main market is the one in Secclla. With her 600 soles loan, she will buy more vegetables like carrots, black potato, celery and onions. Part of what she sells comes from her own small terrain, but she also buys vegetables from other members of the community. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business.

Specifically, she says she would like to start offering more hair accessories and a selection of bracelets and earrings that are popular with teenagers in the area.

In her community people are very poor, and so the demand for used shoes is high; but when people can, they always prefer to have new shoes so she likes to be able to offer both.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the money she is able to generate from this loan, she hopes that her little business will continue to grow, attracting and retaining new customers.  She hopes that the extra income will also help her go back to school and finish her high school education.  One day she dreams of having her own home and her own vehicle so that she can travel around more easily and be able to visit her family and friends more often.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Luciana and everyone here at Esperanza International, we thank you for supporting her dreams and goals!

49906	“VilL. Cotay” is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru’s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations as it is a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 – 5,000 meters above sea level). These limitations incluD. the cold, the difficulty of growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR “VilL. Cotay” is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea level in the community of Cotay, in the district of Anco, province of Churcampa. The small town of Cotay is located where there once used to be an old colonial hacienda, and the people lived there to work on the hacienda. Most business is done with the city of Huancayo, the biggest city nearby and a 4-5 hour drive away. The main activities of the population are related to agriculture and incluD. growing crops like barley, wheat, corn, potato, oca, peas and beans. Most of the population also raises sheep, cattle and small animals.\r\n<p>\r\nThe bank is starting its first loan-cycle with 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 2,400 soles (about 875 US$). The loans range from 100, 200, 300, and up to 500 soles. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group already is in its third loan-cycle in over one year of existence. In their time with FINCA Peru, the members have worked very hard to save and to be more responsible with money and in their businesses. They want to improve the quality of their lives; they are especially motivated because they want their children to have a good education, to be professionals, and to have better opportunities. When talking about the future, these items are the most important ones.\r\n<p>\r\nIn FINCA Perú, what the members have learned and want to continue learning is how to know and understand each other better, how to share responsibilities amongst the members, how to be better entrepreneurs, how to calculate the gains of selling their products, and how to do family planning. When asked about their savings, most are equally-minded. Savings are for improving their businesses and for their children's education or their housing when studying. \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Doris. Doris will receive a loan of 200 soles and has a small business of buying and selling small animals. Besides that, she also sells cereals and clothes. Her business depends a lot on the time of year.  Doris works to support her family, especially the education of her children. Before she did not do a lot. She was not working and depended completely on her husband. Now she runs her own little small business! She is creating her own opportunities and savings as well. Now her husband is jealous sometimes because her business is going well and she is the one earning the money for the household. Her dream is for her children to leave the community, to study to become engineers and that way give something back to the community in future, applying what they studied. (She is very sure her children will help). She has the dream of going to a place where she can run a bigger business. With her savings, she wants to improve her business.\r\n<p>\r\nViviana P. D. L. C. tells another story. She started her business making clothes for children. Together with her husband, they operate some machines for making the clothes and sell them at nearby weekly markets. Another business she runs is buying and selling cereals in Huancayo. When in Huancayo she uses her time to buy more materials for her clothing business. With her 500 soles loan, she will buy more materials in Huancayo. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business and in the education of her children. Besides that she is thinking about buying terrain in Huancayo in the future and a car to be able to move her product. Now that she is in FINCA Perú, she has learned to care for and value herself as she learned to save.\r\n <p>\r\nCipriana L. Montanéz has a small grocery store and sells shoes and clothes in the time the kids go back to school. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more supplies for her store. Her dream for the future is to improve her small store and for her grandchildren to study. (Unfortunately her children did not have the opportunity to study). As well the family is thinking about buying a house in Huancayo where the grandchildren can live when they are studying. In FINCA Perú, she has learned that women can work as well and that they, too, can change something in their lives to improve the quality. Besides that, she has learned to value herself. She wishes her late husband could be alive to see that she is ok!

50116	“Las Rosas D. Anco” is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru’s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 – 5,000 meters above sea level). These limitations incluD. the cold, the difficulty to grow crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR “Las Rosas D. Anco”, is located at approximately 2,300 meters above sea level in the community of Anco, in the district with the same name, province of Churcampa. Anco is located at the border of the Mantaro river and is one of the lowest places in the department of Huancavelica. Due to its relatively low altituD., the area has a warm, almost tropical climate. The warm climate and the vicinity of the river make the area very suitable for growing fruits like oranges, lemons, avocado, papaya and mango. Besides the fruits, most of the people dedicate their time raising guinea-pigs and chicken. They also produce alfalfa, the crop that makes the diet of the guinea-pigs. The town of Anco is situated on the main road between 2 prominent Andes cities: Ayacucho and Huancayo. Business is done with both cities, and also people stopping on the road use the variety of services in town.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 10 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,800 soles (about 1,750 US$). The loans range from 200, 300, 400, 500 and up to 600 soles. \r\nBecause the bank has been formed recently, it has no history yet. The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating now is for investing in their businesses or for the education of their children, whether to buy school uniforms, supplies, books, or even to pay the fees for entering primary or secondary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Flor D. María Q. A.. Flor will receive a loan of 600 soles and has a small business selling food in a kiosk on the main road. Besides that she also raises guinea-pigs. She almost has 200, and business is going well. Her dream for the future is to have her own restaurant, to have a guinea-pig farm with more than 1,000 small animals, and for her children to study. With her savings, she hopes to open her restaurant and maybe go to a bigger place with her husband, somewhere where there is a university where their children can study, where it will be more easy to have a better business.  In FINCA Peru, she wants to learn and save more and learn to valuate herself as a person. \r\n<p>\r\nDoris Sara M. P. tells another story. She runs a small grocery store and has an internet cabin. Besides that, she serves meals to the employees of the district government.  In the future, she wants to improve her grocery store and send her children to study at the university, so they can be professionals. She would like to improve the number of computers. With her 300 soles loan, she will increase her groceries. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business, increasing her internet business, install a fax machine, and open her restaurant.  Now that she is in FINCA Perú, she hopes to to care for and value herself. Most women do not value themselves a lot. Fortunately now there is FINCA Perú which works only with women. She expects to receive trainings on how to improve business and how to work equally with men. (Her husband will do the cooking while she will attend the bank reunion and afterwards she will explain to him what she has learned!).\r\n<p>\r\nTabita Durcal C. A. has a small business selling an elixir of 7 seeds and is running a small grocery store. Besides that she buys and sells cereals and school supplies for the children. With her 400 soles loan, she will buy more supplies for her store. Tabita has many dreams, like improving the lives of her children. When her husband left her, she thought that she would never improve her life and get out of her misery. FINCA Perú, an institution, has come to help the women of the community and help her to be reborn and run her business. With her savings she wants to buy herself her own house and not rent anymore. In FINCA Peru, in her community bank, she hopes to find a new family that will support each other.

501925	Benanacio is 33 years old and lives with his companion Beatriz, age 30.  Their cheerful family includes three young children:  Edgar, Ruth, and María.  Benancio and his family share a home made of wood, which he acquired at a very young age with the help of his parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe inherited a few plots of land from his grandparents, but he was able to expand his acreage by purchasing some additional plots that adjoined that property.  Benancio has six years of experience in this line of work.  He has several cacao trees since this area is well-suited for producing organic crops that are of high quality.  In addition, farming is an activity that has been practiced by his family for many generations.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order for the work to be done correctly, Benancio needs the help of workers who are reliable people from the area.

This type of uniform and efficient maintenance is reflected in the final harvest.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the next growing season, Benancio plans to hire outside help to maintain his cacao trees.  He knows that cacao groves require weed removal three times throughout the season.  The first removal is usually the most difficult and detailed.

Benancio hopes that the large-scale distributors will want to work with him in the future, which will create an opportunity for him to improve his family’s financial condition.  This is the second time he has requested a loan from MFP.  Thanks to this loan, he will have everything he needs to invest in his farming business so that it will run smoothly.  Benancio and his fellow Communal Bank members share the same motivation, so he is grateful to be part of a group that is responsible and demonstrates great camaraderie.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1,500 PEN, Benancio will hire workers for the first round of weed removal from his cacao grove.  Any remaining funds will be used to buy sacks of organic compost, including bird droppings.

She decided to lead an independent life with only her four children by her side, two of whom are young and still require her support and attention. She is the owner of a wooden house where she performs her duties as a mother. \r\n\r\nMaria produces agricultural products, among which is her preferred product, organic cacao, because it is a fruit in high demand in her region and it is easily grown in the area considering everything required. She carries out her agricultural activities on parcels of land she acquired with the help of her ex-partner 20 years ago. In order to obtain the quality of fruits that she wants, she must rely on additional help from laborers on site to carry out distinct complicated tasks. \r\n\r\nShe likes to work in the fields because it reminds her of times when she was a child together with her parents doing the same activities. However, by the time the cacao is ready there is a certain decrease in the final price offered by stockpilers. She is hoping to improve the situation for the next season.\r\n\r\nFinding herself at the start of the season whose harvest is projected for next year, she needs to have capital in order to continue to expand her plantations and to replace old cacao trees respectively. For this reason she needs seedlings, and manure compost from Guano Island. It is also necessary to add the cost of manual labor, whose payment is made in advance. \r\n\r\nNow she is asking for 1000 soles to buy seedlings and bags of compost. The remaining money will be used to supplement the capital to pay the laborers to develop scheduled tasks.

Nevertheless, working together has been a great tool for unity because understanding and family harmony prevail in their family environment.\r\n\r\nA little while ago she received a proposal from a merchant in the area who offered to rent her his store for a long time because he plans to take a trip for a variety of reasons.  She considers it a good opportunity and plans to take it.  So she hopes to contribute to the family finances along with the field work with her husband in charge.\r\n\r\nShe has many desires for the future, including studying pharmacy at the advanced level because she feels she's capable of doing that in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She's very grateful for this opportunity, which she considers the motivation she needs right now to realize her commercial objectives more fluidly.  She's grateful to her colleagues in her communal bank for the great opportunity they're giving her and for their welcome, and she's committing herself to complying with all the stipulated agreements.\r\n\r\nWith the 500 nuevos soles [PEN] she'll supplement the capital she has dedicated to paying the first month's rent on a small grocery store that she'll manage from now on.

Demographically it's small, but there's a wide variety of sites preferred by Ecuadorian and international tourists, especially for ecological and extreme sports activities.\r\n\r\nIt's a city that grows economically every day because of commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism.  For this reason branches of banks and businesses have been established to make the most of the economic activity here.  In every business there are people who, faced with the lack of jobs, have not given up but rather have undertaken ideas for businesses to have a decent life and make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\nMaricela started selling fruits and vegetables on foot when she was pregnant, about four years ago.  The possibility of continuing to study had disappeared, first because of her scarce financial resources and then because of the arrival of her child.  Nevertheless, in spite of the obstacles, she has gotten ahead with her life.  She works ten hours every day.  Her job consists of sorting, cleaning, and selling fruits and vegetables.  When she goes out to sell she stays in strategic locations in neighborhoods where housewives shop.  She learned this business from her parents and now manages it very well.  \r\n\r\nIn this season, tropical fruits such as plums and mangos appear in the market and are in high demand among her customers.  This is why Maricela needs a loan to stock her business with a quantity of these fruits and earn more income to give her son decent lifestyle.  She  also wants to maintain savings she can use in the future for her son's education, to give him a profession, which she herself didn't have the opportunity to have.\r\n\r\nMaricela is grateful to Fundación Alternativa, which adroitly and trustingly gave her the loan and the counseling to manage and carry out her business well.

502378	Florencio is 48 years old and a native of a community called Valle Verde that is full of lush vegetation and where the majority of the inhabitants make a living in commerce. Florencio has worked with VisionFund for less than a year and the loans have helped his business go very well, so he is very content because he can make headway for his family. He belongs to a group called "Aves de Paraíso" ("Birds of Paradise"), which gave itself this name because their meeting place has a thicket of flowers of the same name that aren't very common in the region and are very beautiful. Florencio makes a living making ice creams and sorbets, with flavors like strawberry, coconut, vanilla, lemon, chocolate, apple, cheese, and many others, but these are the ones most requested by his customers, who are mostly children and youths since he sells outside of a elementary and high school in his community. He says that he is requesting the loan to purchase supplies to make his sorbets, such as milk, food dyes, fruits, ice, rock salt, sugar, cones and napkins. He says that he gets up very early to make his sorbets because they need to be ready by the time the children leave school. First he grounds the fruit or adds vanilla to the milk. The trick is with the ice cream. He says that he puts ice and rock salt inside a big pot so it doesn't melt too quickly, and then he puts another metal canister inside with the ingredients and slowly churns it as the ice cream freezes. He says he does this every day so he can take his delicious and rich ice creams to the school. He says that he started this job because he could not find stable work and a friend told him how to make ice cream, so he decided to take up the work. He says, "I enjoy what I do because I already have my customers, and I'm my own boss and have time to be with my family." He has four children who are in elementary and high school, and for this reason he works very hard to provide them with the best and so they don't lack anything in regards to their education. His goal is to purchase a newer moto-tricycle, because the one he has is deteriorating and every time he punctures a tire he has to change it for a new one and pay for it in small payments. The other nine members are Isela, María Remedios, Cirenia, Socorro, Yaquelin, Marcela, María Llasmin, Sandra and Maribel. They invested their loans in ingredients to make tortillas; in the purchase of items for their grocery store; construction materials that they sell; sweets and different savories that they sell; sweets and fritters to sell; seasonal fruit and vegetables; chicken to raise and later sell, etc.

They live in Quinindé, a hamlet in the province of Esmeraldas that provides a number of cities in Ecuador with bananas, cacao, coffee, palm and forest products, and the majority of the inhabitants make a living in commerce.

His 30 years’ experience is very well-known and this is why crafts stores prefer him.  His goal is to double his current production because he has orders pending and needs to buy raw materials in larger amounts which is precisely what motivates him to seek a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundación Mario Santo Domingo that he’ll use to buy fique, wool, thread, sisal rope, reeds, plastic bags, etc.  With his Kiva loan he will put into practice his particular commercial strength because it’s a challenge “to attain great market drive,” as he, himself says.

She gained vast experience this way and sometime later capitalized her business and has it to this day.  \r\n\r\nShe started out buying her work tools with her own income and continued taking refresher beauty courses and gradually expanded her growth possibilities; she purchased furnishings to organize her sales point.  Her drive for advancement led to her opening an academy and she taught courses.  Later on she became still better-known and she got a job that required her to travel frequently so she changed her business for a good job.  Five years after that, though, she returned to her original idea of having her own business.

She’s a beauty consultant and sells cosmetics and hair products at the same time and this is what her customers like best.\r\n\r\nShe’s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundación Mario Santo Domingo that she’ll use to buy hair treatments and cosmetics as well as a display case to keep her inventory well-organized.

502627	Lidia is a 35-year-old Ecuadorian woman. She married young, but she was able to finish high school. She’s currently separated and raising her children on her own – they’re 13, 9 and 6 years old. Although the separation was a difficult time for her children and herself, together they have since become an exemplar family. They live in the Chimbacalle neighborhood that’s located in the south of the city of Quito, which is the capital of the Republic of Ecuador. Up until the last few years, the southern part of Quito was not considered as playing a major part in the economy of the city, but now it’s considered one of the city’s economical strengths. In this area you’ll find determined families who have fought to get ahead. From natives to migrants from other cities and countries, this area has been the meeting point of people from various provinces and has been reconstructed with extensive streets. Chimbacalle, where Lidia resides, is a very commercial neighborhood that is constantly growing and lends itself to the economic growth of the city. There are parks with big green spaces where families meet on the weekends. There is access to a great number of services and the people in this area, with determination, use every opportunity that presents itself to establish new businesses. In this area, you will see street vendors, working children and families in need.\r\nLidia is a street vendor and she's been selling casual clothing for 5 years. This undertaking was very important for her, as it was the only livelihood she had for her herself and her children since the separation. Previous to the separation, she worked as a street vendor and brought in some extra money, but it was more of a hobby; afterwards it became her fulltime job and the income now provides the education and wellbeing of her children. In the beginning, she sold only cosmetics, but there was demand for clothing, so she now dedicates about 6 hours or more each day to taking down orders from her clients, classifying the new clothing she has, delivering the orders to each address and collecting outstanding accounts. All of that work, while still attending to her children; helping them with homework, going over lessons and studying.\r\nLidia is requesting a loan to buy wholesale merchandise in order to get more discounts on her final bill. This will help increase her earnings so that one day she can accomplish her dream: owning her own clothing store that will help sustain her family and provide her children the opportunity to earn professional degrees that will take them further in life. Lidia is grateful that Fundación Alternativa believed in her enough to provide her with a loan and the training needed to visualize and project her business into the future.
