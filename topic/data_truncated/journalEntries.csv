513471	Special Update - One Kiva Lender's Journey to Armenia	<p>The letter and story below was written for you by the CEO of SEF International, one of Kiva's Field Partners in Armenia. The organization truly appreciates your support and hopes you will continue lending to Armenian borrowers on Kiva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Lender, </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your trust and support. Your loans have played a significant role in the lives of borrowers and their families, and have made a positive change in their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to tell you a story about one Kiva lender's visit to his borrowers. It was a great experience for the borrowers, the lender and the SEF team. The lender witnessed the impact his investment had made, the borrowers felt the direct support of the Kiva community, and we at SEF were proud to be a part of their connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to share this eye-opening experience with you and invite you to Armenia to visit your borrowers. We here at SEF stand ready to take care of the logistics for you and help you enjoy your visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you again for your support. You help improve lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garegin Gavorgyan</p>\r\n<p>CEO, SEF International</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SMALL ACTIONS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet Sebastia from Sydney Australia. He joined Kiva in 2011, and has since become one of the site's most active lenders. He's made 329 loans, 190 of which went to SEF borrowers (as of this month). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2012, Sebastia came to Armenia for the first time. He is ethnic Armenian and was excited to see the land of his ancestors, to meet people, and to get acquainted with their lives. Sebastia came to see how the Kiva platform works in the field and how loans have affected the lives of borrowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebastia and Anahit from SEF visited two Kiva borrowers. The first borrower, Ruben, had applied for a loan to purchase carrot seeds and fertilizer for his grape orchard. Ruben grows a large variety of grape types and gladly offered to have Sebastia and Anahit taste all of them as he talked about their different attributes, tastes and cultivation practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruben shared that he would not have had as large a harvest without organic fertilizer, especially since several diseases have become much more common in the region, decreasing the land's productivity. The fertilizer has also ensured the high quality of his grapes. After the harvest, Ruben sells his grapes to a local winery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruben has also started to cultivate carrots in late autumn, which is not the most favorable time for this plant. Last year's carrot harvest was not as good as the grape harvest, but Ruben hasn't lost hope and is determined to grow carrots again this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebastia and Anahit also visited Kiva borrower Susanna, who is also in agriculture.She applied for a loan to purchase two calves, stakes for her grape orchard, plant medicine and organic fertilizer. Susanna was very excited about the calves she has purchased. They'll give her the opportunity to breed cattle and produce more milk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Susanna grows different vegetables in her orchard: peppers, eggplants, and tomatos. The seeds and organic fertilizer she purchased have played an important role in maintaining a healthy harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it was a little early for harvesting tomatos during the visit, Susanna found a few red ones so Sebastia and Anahit could have a taste. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebastia was thrilled to see, touch and taste the tangible results of the loans he made. It was very important for him to talk to the borrowers, learn about the challenges they face, and see how he has helped them. He said he was very excited to support so many Armenian entrepreneurs, and continue collaborating with SEF by making more loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We here at SEF value these experiences and welcome you to visit your borrowers, share your stories and support us in making sure that the poor in Armenia have access to the financial services they need.</p>	Camillle Ricketts	1216382	1	4	4	2012-10-13 06:46:08 -0400
